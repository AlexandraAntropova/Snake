# The snake game

_______________
In this game, the player controls a long, thin snake-like creature that crawls along a plane bounded by walls, eats mice, avoiding collisions with its own tail and the edges of the playing field. Every time the snake eats a piece of food, it gets longer, which gradually complicates the game.
